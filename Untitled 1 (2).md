Hey Tim,

No worries, happy to help. 

How do you maintain the uniqueness of your content while doing research on the internet? 
**- Research helps inform what types of info you should probably consider including, but to keep it unique + valuable we focus on capturing the brand's narrative on a topic. If you're only creating content based on what you see other people doing, your content isn't going to be uniquely valuable, and wont rank in the long run. Another way to think about it is how does the topic you're writing about tie into the product? Probably not something that will ever be automated.** 

Besides uniqueness, what else you think is important and takes lots of your time and energy? 
**- Trying to understand the intent behind a search. In other words, what problems, questions, or challenges motivated someone to make a specific search in google. From there, thinking about what type of content will best satisfy the intent (product landing page, competitor comparison page, long-form informational content, simple glossary definition, etc).**

Are there any repeated tasks in your research/writing workflow that you want to optimize? 
**- Any way to partially automate finding intent would be awesome. Right now, that's basically looking at questions people are asking online. But going deeper than just scraping the "people also ask" box in Google. We'd pay for a tool that did some deep analysis into all the questions people are asking about a topic across the internet. And then maybe a way to see what kind of content is ranking. Clearscope only tells you "Article" or "Other", which is useless.** 

Hope that's helpful!
