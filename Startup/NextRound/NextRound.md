We are building crowd screening service product, focusing on standardize technical interview for small tech startups, that increase the quality of interview, reduce time consuming for interviewee, reduce hiring cost for employers, also reduce the friction of traditional headhunting business.

How


We are a group of software engineers from various top tech companies, one of our friend was talking about how streessful and time consuming doing interviews and that got us thinking maybe we can recreate Google-style standardized interviews and provide a score from 1 ~ 4 as well as detailed feedback in the following categories: "Analytics Skills", "Coding Skills", "Communication", and "Experience.", then we submit your packet directly to various tech companies. 

We will try to convince companies to directly send you job offers if they are satisfied with the interview results, or at least eliminate the phone interviews and let you go directly onsite. TLDR: Interview once, get offers from multiple tech companies at once. Let me know what you think of this idea, and feedback is appreciated!


Let me clarify a little bit, our business model is quite different from these technical screening platforms. Any qualified engineers can join our platform, interview and provide feedback for candidates, then the packet is submitted by our system to various commpanies (essentially we replace tech recruting angencies), if the candidate is hired, the recruting fee (typically 20–25% of one year’s salary in the industry) is paid directly to the interviewer. By doing live and high quality interviews only, companies are able to hire with confidence and save interviewing time, interviewers get paid with recruting fees, and the middleman - tech recruting agencies get eliminated.
